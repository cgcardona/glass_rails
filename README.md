# glass_rails

## Ruby Gem for the Google Glass Mirror API V1

Credit to [https://github.com/thirst/glass-rails](Thirst's glass-rails) gem as
my guidance on creating this gem. 

Instead of simply forking their project I wanted to use this as an opportunity
to learn how to create a gem but make no mistake I am using the `glass-rails`
gem as a learning guide and inspiration.
